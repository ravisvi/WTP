How to implement it:

Word falls down. 
Dictionary of words 
Currently falling down   :    The ones which are currently falling down.  (Only these words are associated with scoring.)
These words are used to see whether he has typed/ he is typing.
Not falling down            :     The ones yet to fall down.
These words are in contention for selection.
successfully typed        :      Already typed successfully.
Successfully typed are not repeated in that game/ session.
A function to choose a word from dictionary. And change the value associated with it to : CFD
A function to take the word from function1b, handles the display of the word. 
Listener associated with a function takes care of scoring:
You need to start with the first alphabet of any word in CFD
No mistakes.  (mistakes) = reset
Once typed call function1e
function1e:
Destroys the word in some spectacular fashion.
Pause the play: Show a word and itâ€™s meaning:  (10 words)
Ask for the meaning/ synonym at the end of the game.
